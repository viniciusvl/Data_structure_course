# TREES

Trees are non linear data structures. They are useful to represent hierarchical relations between data.

**NODE:** each data of the tree

**ROOT:** the first node

**LEAF:** last node of a tree

**HEIGHT:** greatest distance between the root and leaf. 

- The height of a empty tree is equal -1, whereas a tree that has one node (root) is equal 0

**DEEPTH:** the distance between a node ant the root


## Recursion:
Most of a tree's functions uses recursion algorithms. In show_tree, for example, we use recursion to iterate thorough the left side of a tree and then thorugh the right side
